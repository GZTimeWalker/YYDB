# Y-Engine

Yat another MySQL storage engine.

Database course project written in Rust.

## How does this Rust project work with MySQL?

This project is a MySQL storage engine. We only support compiling with `MYSQL_DYNAMIC_PLUGIN` enabled, which means the final binary is a shared library (`.so` on Linux) that is loaded by the MySQL server.

The compilation process is as follows:

```log
                                       MySQL source dir
+------------------+-+                ./storage/yengine
|    ha_wapper.h   | |   Copy        +-----------------+-+
|     yengine.h    | +-----------+   |  CMakeLists.txt | |
|   ha_wapper.cc   | |           |   +-----------------+ |
|    yengine.cc    | |           +-> |   C++ sources   | +--+
+------------------+-+               +-----------------+ |  |
                                 +-> |   libyengine.a  | |  |
+------------------+-+           |   +-----------------+-+  |
| bridge.rs (Rust) | |           |                          |
| bridge.cc (C++)  | | cxxbridge |            Compile CXX   |
+------------------+ +-----------+         & Link Rust libs |
|   lib.rs (Rust)  | | Rust Compile                         |

```

## How to build or develop this project?

We provide a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) for you to develop this project. You can use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to open this project and press `F1` to run `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container` to start the Dev Container.

Since it takes about 10GB+ of disk space to build MySQL, the default container does not come with MySQL source code. If you need to do a full build with MySQL, please edit the `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yaml` file and change the `dockerfile: .devcontainer/Dockerfile` to `dockerfile: .devcontainer/Dockerfile.full` and create the container, or you can do a manual source install via `scripts/install-source.sh`.

Then you can simply run `scripts/depoly.sh && scripts/build.sh` to build the project.
